## 🔧 How It Works

1. User wears the smart glove embedded with flex and health sensors.
2. The glove continuously monitors pulse rate and temperature.
3. Recognized hand gestures trigger specific actions:
   - Turn on/off lights and fans
   - Send emergency alerts
   - Activate buzzers or alarms
4. If abnormal health data is detected:
   - GPS module retrieves coordinates
   - RF module sends alert with location to caregivers

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Connect hardware based on the circuit diagram (see `/schematics`).
2. Upload the code to Arduino Mega using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power up the glove using a rechargeable battery pack.
4. Calibrate sensor thresholds (e.g., for pulse and temperature).
5. Test gesture responses and validate health sensor readings.
